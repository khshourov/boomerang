# Task 4.2.3: Implement TCP and HTTP Callback Protocols

## Objective
Implement the outbound delivery logic for raw TCP (Protobuf) and HTTP (Webhook) protocols.

## Requirements
- **TCP:** Use Netty to establish a connection and send a `BoomerangEnvelope` with the payload.
- **HTTP:** Use `java.net.http.HttpClient` to POST the binary payload to the registered endpoint.
- Support basic connection pooling.

## Proposed Changes
### `io.boomerang.server.callback.TcpCallbackHandler`
- Netty-based client.
- Serializes `TimerTask` into a format the client expects (likely the same envelope or a simplified callback message).

### `io.boomerang.server.callback.HttpCallbackHandler`
- `HttpClient` implementation.
- Sets appropriate `Content-Type: application/x-protobuf` or `application/octet-stream`.

## Verification Plan
- Integration tests with a mock Netty TCP server.
- Integration tests with a mock HTTP server (e.g., using Netty or a simple `HttpServer`).
