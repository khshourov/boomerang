# Review: Task 4.2.5 - Integrate CallbackDispatcher with Core Engine

## Status
- **Approved:** Yes
- **Review Date:** 2026-02-21
- **Reviewer:** Gemini CLI

## Findings
- **Correctness:** `BoomerangBootstrap` correctly wires `DefaultCallbackDispatcher` into `TieredTimer` and coordinates the task lifecycle on expiration.
- **Standards:** All components are properly integrated through constructor injection and dependency management.
- **Completeness:** `TieredTimer` expiration callback correctly handles task deletion, automatic rescheduling for repeatable tasks, and retry engine fallback for failed dispatches.

## Recommendations
- **Rescheduling Condition:** The code correctly reschedules tasks *only* on successful dispatch. This prevents a repeatable task from being rescheduled if it's currently being retried by the `RetryEngine`.
- **Testing:** `BoomerangBootstrapIntegrationTest` should be updated or added to verify this end-to-end integration with mock protocol servers.
