# Review: Task 4.2.2 - Define CallbackDispatcher Infrastructure

## Status
- **Approved:** Yes
- **Review Date:** 2026-02-21
- **Reviewer:** Gemini CLI

## Findings
- **Correctness:** `CallbackDispatcher` and `CallbackHandler` interfaces provide a clean abstraction for the multi-protocol callback engine. `DefaultCallbackDispatcher` correctly implements the routing logic.
- **Standards:** Javadoc is present for all public interfaces and implementations. Guard clauses and early returns are used appropriately.
- **Completeness:** The infrastructure handles client lookups and protocol-specific routing as required.

## Recommendations
- **Thread Safety:** `DefaultCallbackDispatcher` uses `ConcurrentHashMap` for handlers, which is good. Handlers should also ensure they are thread-safe or initialized such that they can handle concurrent requests if shared.
