# Review: Task 5.6 - Java Client SDK (`boomerang-client-java`)

## Review Metadata
- **Reviewer:** Gemini CLI
- **Commit Reviewed:** 008e9f714b8c9daf8a95a7eafb0e640f8c67a816 (with subsequent fixes)
- **Status:** Approved

## Overview
The implementation provides a solid foundation for the Java Client SDK. Following the initial review, critical issues regarding session management, retry logic, and threading have been resolved.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Smart Client & Session Management (Resolved)
- **Robust Retry Logic:** `SmartBoomerangClient` now uses typed `Status` codes from `BoomerangException` to determine if a request is retryable (e.g., `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `UNAUTHORIZED`).
- **Correct Retry Trigger:** `DefaultBoomerangClient` has been updated to throw `BoomerangException` with the appropriate status whenever the server returns a non-OK status. This ensures the `SmartBoomerangClient` reliably triggers automatic re-login for all operations.

### 2. Callback Receivers (Resolved)
- **TCP Receiver Threading:** `TcpCallbackReceiver` now uses a dedicated acceptor thread and a worker pool for processing connections, following a more idiomatic and robust design pattern.
- **Protocol Support:** Comprehensive support for TCP, UDP, HTTP, and gRPC callbacks with appropriate framing and error handling.

### 3. Code Quality & Testing (Positive)
- **Testing:** Unit tests have been expanded to cover all status-based error paths and retry scenarios.
- **Mutation Testing:** PITest mutation score is now **81%**, exceeding the project's requirement of 80%.
- **Documentation:** `README.md` provides clear instructions and examples for end-users.

## Conclusion
The Java Client SDK is now robust, reliable, and well-tested. It adheres to the project's architectural vision and technical standards.
