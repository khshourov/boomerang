# Task 7.4: Configure Mutation Testing

## Description
Integrate PITest into the Boomerang project to ensure high-quality test suites. Mutation testing will help identify "surviving mutants"—code changes that are not caught by existing tests—providing a more robust measure of test effectiveness than standard line coverage.

## Objectives
- [ ] Add the PITest Gradle plugin to the root `build.gradle.kts`.
- [ ] Configure PITest centrally to apply to all subprojects except `boomerang-proto`.
- [ ] Set the mutation coverage threshold to 80%.
- [ ] Update `docs/GUIDELINES.md` to reflect the new coverage requirements and mutation testing workflow.
- [ ] Verify the configuration by running `./gradlew pitest` on `boomerang-core`.

## Technical Details
- **Plugin:** `info.solidsoft.pitest` (version `1.19.0-rc.3` for Gradle 9 compatibility).
- **JUnit 5 Support:** Explicitly configure `junit5PluginVersion` in the PITest extension in each module.
- **Module Configuration:** Applied and configured in `boomerang-core/build.gradle.kts` and `boomerang-cli/build.gradle.kts`.
- **Exclusions:** `boomerang-proto` is excluded by not applying the plugin.
- **Thresholds:**
    - Mutation Score: 80% (Note: `boomerang-cli` is temporarily set to 0% until more logic is implemented).
    - Unit Test Coverage (JaCoCo): 80% (Enforced centrally in root `build.gradle.kts`).

## Verification Plan
1.  Run `./gradlew pitest` and ensure it executes for `boomerang-core` and `boomerang-cli` (if applicable) but skips `boomerang-proto`.
2.  Check that the build fails if mutation coverage falls below 80% (can be tested by temporarily increasing the threshold or weakening a test).
3.  Confirm that `docs/GUIDELINES.md` reflects the updated standards.
