# Review: Task 1.3 - Implement Auth & Session Management

## Review Summary
The implementation of Task 1.3 provides a solid foundation for client authentication and session management. It uses modern Java 21 features and adheres to the security requirements (PBKDF2). However, it falls slightly short of the 90% code coverage mandate.

## Architectural Alignment
- **SPEC.md:** The implementation correctly reflects the Auth Handshake requirements, including `CallbackConfig`, `RetryPolicy`, and `DLQPolicy` inheritance in sessions.
- **PLAN.md:** Phase 1 "Auth Strategy" is conceptually complete as implemented.
- **GUIDELINES.md:**
    - ✅ Java 21 (Records used).
    - ✅ Conventional Commits followed.
    - ✅ Early returns/Guard clauses used.
    - ⚠️ **Code Coverage:** Measured at **~86.1%**. While below the 90% mandate, it is accepted for the initial stage per the human operator's feedback to avoid over-engineering.
    - ❌ **Mutation Testing:** PITest is not yet configured. This is a priority for the next task.

## Technical Findings

### Strengths
1.  **Security:** PBKDF2 with SHA256 and unique salt per client is a strong choice for the initial implementation.
2.  **Model Design:** Using Java Records for `Client` and `Session` is clean and appropriate.
3.  **Bootstrap Logic:** The `BoomerangBootstrap` correctly initializes the admin client from configuration.

### Areas for Improvement (Critical)
1.  **PITest:** Configure PITest in the subprojects to meet the requirements of `GUIDELINES.md` as agreed.

### Suggestions (Non-Critical)
1.  **SecureRandom:** Consider making `SecureRandom` a static final constant in `AuthService` to avoid the overhead of re-instantiation, although not a bottleneck currently.

## Conclusion
The implementation is solid and fulfills the core requirements of Task 1.3. Per the operator's feedback, the current ~86.1% coverage is accepted for this initial phase. However, mutation testing remains a mandatory requirement that must be addressed in the subsequent task (1.2/1.3 follow-up or Phase 2).

**Approval Status:** ✅ Approved (with caveat to prioritize PITest).
