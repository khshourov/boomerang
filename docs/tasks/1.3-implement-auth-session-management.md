# Task 1.3: Implement Auth & Session Management

## Status: Complete ✅

## Objective
Implement a traditional `client_id`/`password` authentication mechanism and manage client sessions using a volatile (in-memory) store.

## Implementation Details
- Created `Client` and `Session` models.
- Implemented `AuthService` with PBKDF2 password hashing.
- Implemented `SessionManager` for managing session lifecycle.
- Configured admin client via `ServerConfig`.
- Added `registerClientByAdmin` for dynamic client registration.
- Verified with unit and integration tests.

## Next Steps
- Implement persistent storage for non-admin clients (RocksDB/etcd).
- Hook session validation into the Netty pipeline (Phase 4).
