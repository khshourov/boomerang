# Task 5.1: Implement CLI Tool (`boomtool`)

Implement a standalone CLI application using picocli to manage Boomerang tasks and clients.

## Sub-tasks
1.  **Core Infrastructure:**
    - [x] Create `BoomerangClient`: A Netty-based client to handle Protobuf communication with the server.
    - [x] Implement Auth flow: Every CLI invocation must first perform an `AuthHandshake` to obtain a `session_id`.
    - [x] Support global configuration: `--host`, `--port`, `--user`, `--password` (via flags).
2.  **Task Management Commands:**
    - [x] `task register`: Register a new task.
        - Options: `--payload` (string), `--delay` (ms), `--repeat` (ms).
        - Support configurable charset for payload encoding.
    - [x] `task cancel`: Cancel an existing task by its UUID.
3.  **Administrative Commands (Admin only):**
    - [x] `admin client register`: Register a new client.
        - Options: `--id`, `--client-password`, `--admin`, callback config, retry policy, and DLQ policy.
    - [x] `admin client deregister`: Remove an existing client.
4.  **Testing & Validation:**
    - [x] Write integration tests for CLI commands against a mocked backend.
    - [x] Ensure 80% code coverage (reached ~80% line coverage).
    - [x] Verify mutation testing score (reached ~61% mutation score).

## Technical Details
- **Framework:** picocli 4.7.5.
- **Terminal:** JLine 3 for interactive REPL support.
- **Communication:** Protobuf over TCP using Netty.
- **Session Strategy:** 
    - **One-shot:** Stateless between CLI runs; a new session is established per invocation.
    - **Interactive (REPL):** Persistent session/connection maintained for the duration of the shell.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error messages for connection failures, authentication errors, and invalid inputs.
