# Task 4.2.5: Integrate CallbackDispatcher with Core Engine

## Objective
Wire the `CallbackDispatcher` into the `TieredTimer` and `BoomerangBootstrap` to replace the placeholder "DISPATCH" log.

## Requirements
- Replace the anonymous `Consumer<TimerTask>` in `BoomerangBootstrap` with a call to `CallbackDispatcher.dispatch()`.
- Ensure exceptions from the dispatcher trigger the `RetryEngine`.
- Ensure successful dispatching deletes the task from `LongTermTaskStore` and handles re-scheduling for recurring tasks.

## Proposed Changes
### `io.boomerang.BoomerangBootstrap`
- Instantiate `DefaultCallbackDispatcher`.
- Pass it to `TieredTimer`.

## Verification Plan
- Full end-to-end integration test:
    1. Register a task.
    2. Start a mock callback server.
    3. Wait for the timer to fire.
    4. Verify the mock server receives the payload.
    5. Verify the task is removed from RocksDB or rescheduled.
