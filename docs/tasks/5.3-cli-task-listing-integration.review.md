# Review: Task 5.3 - CLI Integration for Task Listing

- **Status:** Approved
- **Reviewer:** Gemini CLI
- **Commit:** 7ef48e5a1610bf4a3983fe8897116dd14f356180

## Summary
The implementation of Task 5.3 is comprehensive and adheres to the project's standards and architectural vision. The `task list` and `task get` commands are well-integrated into the `boomtool` CLI, supporting advanced filtering, pagination, and detailed task inspection.

## Key Accomplishments
- **BoomerangClient Update:** Successfully implemented `listTasks` and `getTask` methods using the session-aware `sendRequest` mechanism.
- **TaskListCommand:** Implemented robust filtering (client ID, scheduled interval, recurrence) and pagination. The interval parser supports common units (s, m, h, d) and handles composite durations (e.g., `1h30m`).
- **TaskGetCommand:** Provides detailed task details and configurable payload decoding, defaulting to UTF-8.
- **CLI Integration:** Commands are properly registered in `BoomTool` and are accessible in both one-shot and interactive modes.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests for both new commands, using mocked client interactions to verify command logic and output formatting.
- **Plan Update:** `docs/PLAN.md` was correctly updated to reflect task completion.

## Observations & Suggestions
- **Interval Parser:** The current implementation of `parseIntervalToEpoch` returns `now + totalMs`. This is correct for relative time filtering as requested.
- **Error Handling:** The CLI provides clear error messages when server responses indicate failure.
- **Pagination:** The `--all` flag and manual `next_token` usage are correctly implemented, ensuring smooth listing of large result sets.

## Verification Results
- All new unit tests pass successfully.
- Code follows project formatting and Javadoc standards.
- Minimum code coverage requirements appear to be met for the new logic.

## Conclusion
The implementation is solid and ready for the next phase.

**Approval granted.**
